	This abstract provides a succinct overview of our work focused on semantic segmentation using the PASCAL VOC-2007 dataset. Our approach involves leveraging a novel deep learning architecture tailored for semantic segmentation tasks. We meticulously preprocess the dataset, addressing challenges such as class imbalance and data augmentation to enhance model generalization. Through experimentation, we explore hyperparameter tuning strategies to optimize performance. Our results showcase a notable improvement in both percent correct and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics, underscoring the efficacy of our methodology. Additionally, we uncover intriguing insights into the model's behavior, shedding light on its strengths and potential areas for refinement. This work showcases a framework for accurate and nuanced semantic segmentation.
