\section*{Discussion}
% The Discussion section should again have 3 sub-sections for Q3, Q4 and Q5. In each section you should discuss the benefits (and drawbacks if any) of the approaches/architectures you used and some discussion of why you think you got the results you got.
% Please discuss the following important points as well: How did the performance of your implementations differ? Discuss the performance differences with respect to the baseline (part 3), improved baseline (part 4) and compare the other implementations (part 5a, 5b, 5c) and mention them in their respective sub-sections. Also, draw insights from the plotted loss curves, tables and the visualizations.

- Benefits
- Drawbacks
- Why we got the results we got
